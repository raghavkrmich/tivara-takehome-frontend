Takehome FrontEnd

- Running the FrontEnd:

In order to run this locally you first need to make a new directory and inside this directory you need to run the command "npm init". Then you can bring over all the code from this repository (clone it). Next you will need to make sure you use npm to install all the necessary dependencies. All of these dependencies can be found in the package.json file under the dependencies key. Once you have installed all of this content, from the root of the directory run:

npm run dev

This starts the frontend for the project. Now follow the link provided to the localhost site and you can interact with the software!
